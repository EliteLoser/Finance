# Tax Payers Insure Stocks

This is ridiculous, right? At the very least at the scale that has taken place recently and now for the last 13 years since the financial
crisis of 2007 when the Lehman bank went under in the US and caused a major crisis in its wake.

The purpose of taxes, as I see it, is to distribute wealth according to needs that are defined by an elite. Sadly the elite we have is
what we call politicians, and these politicans are human, meaning a (negative) diversity arises, but let's stick to the basics of my interpretation.
Offering free health care is one such need that is likely to be better handled by a "paternal/maternal/parental state", since it is in line
with being kind and humane. Roads, military service, trains, power grids and food supply are other things I think are natural to include, but
you can stretch it further (and we can, and should, do). A lot is needed, the world is complex. There are many laws. Not enough laws are accurate and
logical, sensical and not to mention up to date.

Anyway, if you as a tax payer insure stocks through QE (quantitative ease), should you not be offered any rewards, then? Implicitly even the
often-used example of the low paid fast food worker is contributing to insure stocks on the stock markets through their work and subsequently taxes.
What I suggest is completely logical: A reverse tax that pays back money to every single person that paid taxes (reduction in taxes or downright
payouts), in line with how much the stock market rose in that fiscal year (time period for historical/practical reasons).

It's actually similar to how the tax system in Norway now rewards people who are invested in "80 % or more stocks papers", if I remember correctly.
If you own 10,000 kroner worth of Equinor stocks, you will get a discount in taxes based on the value, that's again later countered by another tax. It
has become complex, but what lies underneath it all is this: Uneven distribution is enhanced. People with "spare money" who can invest are given
benefits over those who cannot.

Yet, how can this be logical if the tax payer from McDonald's also helps to insure the stock she has never heard of
through her taxes? Should the tax payers then not be rewarded? My first thoughts were about linking the "reverse tax"/reward to stock market performance,
but there might be thinking I'm not done with that says a fixed percentage is better. What that percentage would be is interesting; the reasoning
better not be "random".

In short: Tax payers need to be rewarded monetarily for the risk they highly implicitly assume by even working to produce income that the state then
claims to have rights to part of. If the average tax payer knew what their money was being spent on, 
such as the 200 billion NOK down the Equinor "conquer the US
stock market effort" drain. I read the amount downright "wasted" was closer to 19-20 billion NOK, but that's not small change either.
