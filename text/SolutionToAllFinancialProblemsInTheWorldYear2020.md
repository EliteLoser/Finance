# The Ultimate Solution (and only)

Just crash the markets, let them go down 50-60 %, then we can start to go back up, and experience "normal" interest rates, inflation and shit.

Just invest in stocks and it grows back. Simple, just like macro economics!

The Norwegian Oil fund will lose about 5-6 thousand billions in value, but that's no probs, just get it back into the growth pattern. Japan is still knee deep
in this, so idk. We're so screwed it's ridiculous. It's giving me a serious soul ache.

QE as a means to direct tax payer money into rich people's (financial investors tend to include that group) pockets? End QE, please, just let the shit hit the fan.
Let it blow up, stop controlling it. Fuck the greedy pigs who are invested with too much risk, let them learn. 
Fuck the companies that mismanaged risk and go under. Fuck it all, just start over, wiser and stronger. Let the world learn. Other alternatives include
North Korea, Iran and nuclear wars, so I prefer the option of blowing up the stock markets rather than the world.
