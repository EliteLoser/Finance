# The Ultimate Solution (and only)

Just crash the markets, let them go down 50-60 %, then we can start to go back up, and experience "normal" interest rates, inflation and shit.

Just invest in stocks and it grows back. Simple, just like macro economics!

The Norwegian Oil fund will lose about 5-6 billions in value, but that's no probs, just get it back into the growth pattern. Japan is still knee deep
in this, so idk. We're so screwed it's ridiculous. It's giving me a serious soul ache.
