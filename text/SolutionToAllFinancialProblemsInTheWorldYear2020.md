# The Ultimate Solution (and only)

Just crash the markets, let them go down 50-60 %, then we can start to go back up, and experience "normal" interest rates, inflation and shit.

Just invest in stocks and it grows back. Simple, just like macro economics!

The Norwegian Oil fund will lose about 5-6 thousand billions in value, but that's no probs, just get it back into the growth pattern. Japan is still knee deep
in this, so idk. We're so screwed it's ridiculous. It's giving me a serious soul ache.

QE as a means to direct tax payer money into rich people's (financial investors tend to include that group) pockets? End QE, please, just let the shit hit the fan.
Let it blow up, stop controlling it. Fuck the greedy pigs who are invested with too much risk, let them learn. 
Fuck the companies that mismanaged risk and go under. Fuck it all, just start over, wiser and stronger. Let the world learn. Other alternatives include
North Korea, Iran and nuclear wars, so I prefer the option of blowing up the stock markets rather than the world.

Since when does the stock market need a nanny (QE)? May I then suggest better distributed, and targeted, QE? But, sorry, choices about which companies
should be made based on criteria other than under-the-table payments and corruption among politicians. I also think ethics should be a significant 
part of it - without being extreme. If QE then suddenly means that a _select few_ of the investors are suddenly boosted, then it's yet another bad thing. Idk
how to avoid that, because people are so greedy and stupid it continually blows my mind what they are willing to do to wipe their asses with the Bible, if they
were Christians, or an ethics book if they're able to think deeper (for themselves...). Narratives aids understanding, so in that sense the religious texts
are successful and powerful ways to convey content, especially within the "holy"/sacred mentality/framework that's built around it. I digress...
