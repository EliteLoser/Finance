# Index funds don't target specifically - on purpose - and why this can be a problem

Just some small thoughts. 2020-10-16.

I recently listened to a podcast where they talked about index funds. The guru I won't name for now said index funds target all companies in the index;
good and bad. This seems obvious once stated, but it actually hadn't occurred to me in this way. I read research (Norwegian text: 
https://fil.forbrukerradet.no/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/analyse-av-aksjefond-flaks-eller-dyktighet.pdf ) which basically concludes that index funds is the
better option. Best value for money historically based on the last 20 years or so. They also quoted numerous other research papers
which showed little to no
correlation mathematically between performance and consistency among fund managers. 
As a sidenote, I notice the research is no longer fronted on their pages listing mutual funds and other investment instruments, as it was
not long ago.


For this reason, I went for index funds because of the lower costs combined with seemingly better performance. 
The MIFID (II) regulation for finance markets now causes different pricing ranges and options, more in favor
of actively managed funds. The disadvantage the nameless guru explained about index funds is precisely the bad companies within the index, and the "squeeze",
or lack of money flow, into the good companies outside the index. Being listed on the index is sort of
like being guaranteed money through both QE (quantitative ease) and investors/speculation.


This has now caused me to rethink my strategy, without action so far, but it is likely I will rebalance my tiny savings monthly in favor of sectors I think
can stand the test of time in my 20-year plan (I'm sure that will change along the way). Then again, won't they all, except maybe fossil fuels and some
cases that will also disappear for reasons we might not imagine now, due to technological advancement or similar.


The cyclic nature of stock markets says it's a question of time before we hit a wall (markets crash), 
this time with inflated debt and more at stake than ever, but/and it also
might explain the reason the fund managers don't deliver contrary to how their cycle or commodity or main industry that's targeted, etc. etc. performs.
Why do, or rather did,
index funds perform better? Lower costs is the primary reason I suspect, plus sheer _stability_/volume.
It seems unfair to blame it on the fund managers' ineptitude, although as a retarded small
investor myself, I can say that unwise trades have been performed during human existence. This should apply to other humans, including some of the best.
There is sure to be differences
and maybe chasing after the good managers isn't as unwise as I had come to think. That said, hypes are hypes; they don't last forever (but sometimes longer
than you would think; look at where we are now globally, in the middle of a pandemic - markets seemingly thriving). Either way, I am forced to rethink my
strategies.


As the nameless guru pointed out, bad companies get to survive - and prices are 
in general inflated and become "extra high" within the index due to mandates of countless financial instruments
like mutual funds and hedge funds - and stuff I don't know much about - and where/what they are allowed to buy/invest in (within the index only, 
usually evenly distributed).
The filth isn't washed out and companies without earnings or cash may survive based on
the constant flow of money in to not only all the "worthy" companies but the aforementioned "bad" companies as well. Some are downright scams.


There is so much messed up stuff within this sector that it blows my mind when I hear and read about it. Psychology is important indeed.
I also realize the world is a very dangerous place to live in...


A friend of a friend once paid 2000 bitcoin for a pizza at a convention. Now the big nothing that is Bitcoin is worth billions of dollars, based on
people's perception of value, their greed and willingness to take risk and gamble, and the underlying psychology that goes with it all.
That pizza would have cost roughly 22 million USD based on the current exchange rate. Today it might perhaps strike most as a rather unwise price to pay
for a pizza, but at the time it seemed acceptable.


Lately, people invest in "everything". There are seemingly no limits to what people try to trade to generate money. Digital cryptographic 
coins and the frequency of new
"ICOs", initial coin offerings, in and around 2017, speaks for how "desperate" people are for investment opportunities.


That was all for now. (No, I don't really have anything better to do).
