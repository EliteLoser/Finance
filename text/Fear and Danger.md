# Fear and Danger

Initially written 2021-08-18.

As I'm reading in "Factfulness", a good book by Hans Rosling, Ola Rosling and Anna Rosling RÃ¶nning, there is a difference betwen what we fear and what is
(the most) dangerous. It just happened to occur to me that (within the financial world!) 
I fear corrections in the stock market, being invested with a not entirely insignificant amount
(to me - I'm no millionaire). But the danger is the "global Japan scenario": a cataclysmic crash that spins the world decades back in "fiscal time".

Someone once said to me that it doesn't matter when you buy funds as long as you don't buy on a peak/top. I reflected on this statement a lot.
Defining the peak is hard, but you could say
February 2020 was a peak before a correction/crash, I suppose, as the most recent significant example. But, today, that peak is no longer the highest level, and
this is the nature of stock markets: it's a series of new peaks followed by corrections - or in reverse order, if you prefer. Record high levels are to
be expected and do not necessarily mean you are in danger, but they often cause fear. Once the record is in the past, followed by a certain amount of new records,
it becomes familiar and known to you as "how history went", and your fears are no longer about that level, 
but about the now new record high levels. Not entirely sure how to convey the thoughts I have here, but something about the time element.

I once spent an evening reading a bank blog from 2011-2015 or so (as stated in another "text"). 
The attitude was always that danger is imminent and fear was clearly shining through
the words and sentiments. Already in 2011 the debt size of the US and other countries was brought up as something that could end the bull/up market. Ten
years down the line - here we still are. We did see a major correction in March 2020 in the wake of the covid-19 pandemic. Once again the markets recovered and
are now back at levels significantly higher than in February 2020, before covid-19. The technology sector has been described as a bubble for years already.
It just keeps going.

My "career" with savings/investing started in 2013. From 2013 to 2021 I have sold _everything_ 3 times. Each time, I was driven by fear after
talking to friends/family who warned me of imminent danger. Driven by fear of being in
danger (in the financial world...). Each time, I was utterly wrong, and missed out on decent/huge profits in the longer run.
I have learned a lot about myself and how I deal with this type of psychological risk as time went by.
Yesterday, I once again sold, but this time not everything. You see,
I read the famous Michael Burry had predicted a fall in prices. Surely a guy who was right in 2007 can't be wrong now... Or can he?
I reduced my fund ownership share by about 10 %. Today when the sales orders went through, and as I wait for them to complete, 
I already regret the sale. I had decided
on a risk level - and it's best to stick to that if you are actually confident that you are comfortable with the risk you decided on previously. Knowing myself
a bit, I know it's quite likely I will repurchase funds soon, maybe already next week. 
I will take it as an opportunity to rebalance the portfolio and possibly make some changes. Might
go for more active funds over passive. The vast majority is currently in passive index funds. About "how much risk/losses am I comfortable with", I have
heard that most people are comfortable with significantly less risk than they claim before calamity strikes (the stock markets...). It was a fund
manager who said people came to him when their value was reduced with a certain fraction of what they said they could handle to lose. To my detriment,
I forgot the fraction/percentage! Was it 20 %? One third? Something along those lines is what I remember. Or was it half...

With a time horizon of 5-10 years things change regarding how much risk you can take. As long as you are willing to see the value of your money fluctuate, and
quite possibly go down for years, you can still "win" if you wait it out. This is why the "Japan scenario" is troublesome; it means waiting up to 30 years.
Given my age, that is too long to wait. 
I choose to gamble with about 1/3 of what I have in funds with a timeframe of 5-10 years in mind. I should really just ignore it and not check my bank
for the next 3 years.
If I had done this in 2013 and had just stuck to monthly savings, it would have been vastly superior as a strategy compared to panic selling once every 3 years 
on average. If I was rich I would likely have a higher percentage than 30 in "the markets", I need to keep some "bank account cash" in case of
 unexpected expenses.  I have a symbolic amount in Bitcoin as well, one that grew into
a not-entirely-symbolic amount at the time of writing. There seems no end to that Ponzi scheme.

What did I just say? Not much that isn't obvious... I'm lacking a point here as well. "Don't panic sell", maybe.
Guess it's mostly social. Hope you enjoyed reading, then!

Au revoir.
