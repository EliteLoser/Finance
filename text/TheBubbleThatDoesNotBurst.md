# The Bubble That Does Not Burst?

Initial notes: 2020-08-06.

I caught myself wondering about something relatively trivial, yet not, as most would agree in the finance sector, which I have studied from afar mostly.
There is little to no doubt among the finance experts that markets are overpriced. Even the eccentrics seem to agree. This based on what I have heard
and read.
It is said that the markets are now run by governments and I saw
a prominent figure say we now have "zombie markets" disconnected from real economy, with higher debt and more inherent risk.


The US is being very socialistic, I think, through the FED (Federal Reserve, national bank)
by injecting all that money. Sadly, it probably mostly serves to save or generate income for already wealthy people more than it does the commoner and
"most people" sufficiently good. Although avoiding bankruptcies keeps people employed, of course. As well
as other important factors, such as the steady supply of needed goods. That said, it is quite contrary
to how the US represents itself politically.

As I was thinking about this tool of "quantitative" help from the government by injecting new money in the stock markets,
I suddenly wondered what would happen if they distributed the money
evenly among the US citizens, which according to Wikipedia is 328 million as of now. The answer is that a 2000 billion dollar package simply divided
by 328 million is 6097 USD for each citizen. Then I had spin-off thoughts about creating government "companies" that just distributed the borrowed and
printed money. What would happen and what is going on now? Does the whole system need an overhaul? The Private Equity scam is horrendous, by the way.
At times it all seems like "fun and games", except without the fun at the moment. Something fundamental is shifting here, but I cannot see properly
where it is leading.


Recently, I had thoughts of growing up in a world where China was the dominating cultural influence globally instead of the US. It occurred to me
that I then would find "China normal", if I grew up with it, and maybe "fear" the western thinking more, inversely to how my childhood was, with American
movies and influence everywhere. The future may turn out differently for the children growing up - I guess it already is, but attitude changes
tend to move across generations (this based on solid research I read), so it's a fairly slow process.


I spent an evening reading about the fear and uncertainty that was all over the articles in a "random" bank blog dating back to 2011, and kept
reading until 2015 or so before I discontinued, now
in retrospect knowing it would turn out to be the longest bull (positive/up) market in history, unless I am misinformed, I read it posted by a finance expert,
so I think it is correct. It ended when the bull market ended this year if I remember correctly and there were no previous dips significant enough.
I forgot the numbers, but I think we went 10-12 years on the broad US/world financial indicator that is the 
S&P 500 index, with overall positive momentum semi short term.


The quite simple question I am then left with is if this is a bubble that will not quite burst, meaning an entirely new macro-economic reality
we need to account for as humans thinking about our pensions that increasingly are being demanded to be self-provided
due to an ageing population, or is it
a bubble after all? Debt has skyrocketed and the US debt size is frightening at this point, but as
it so happens, that is exactly the concerns they, among others, had in 2011-2015, but it did not affect the stock markets.
Governments keep injecting money and the disconnect grows. Capitalism sort of
is not allowed to work the way it was built, both for better and worse. Investors and commoners alike 
are left with this conundrum I am now debating with myself here.


If we look to history, Japan still has not recovered from the 1990 levels on the stock markets, and it is entirely possible that this can happen again,
elsewhere -
but will the governments allow it? Furthermore, will it even be their choice?
Will they "run out of tools"? How much debt can a country, particularly the US, have before - you know - 
it has any consequences...? I find the world an odd place at the moment within this sector, as I know some others also do. Is a P/E of 500 or for that
matter 8000, as I think the extreme example of the Tesla stock must be close to, just to be
expected and a green signal for investors to invest within this new reality? The correlation between asset values and income generated in companies vs
share price is maybe at record lows overall, without
having researched that to decisively make the statement (speculation and a feeling, sorry, maybe 90s Japan was close? other? ... open an issue if you know!
(part joke)).


I heard there are "new players", literally, as in young people using apps such as "Robin Hood" to trade and take enormous risks. For a young person it
is, due to expected remaining years alive, of course less risky overall to invest long term, since a recovery even from a severe crash
is more likely to occur within their lifetime and before they need the money, hopefully. But a lot is also traders. What role does this play? It provides
what is called liquidity, likely more persistently inflated prices and more money in the markets overall if my understanding is correct. Beyond that I
am not sure, but I am quite confident it somehow mostly enriches the already richest 0.n % of the population in the end. I might have a dystopian (or
in this case realistic) view.


So, will the bubble burst? I know nobody knows.


What am I currently doing? Investing the small parts of my salary I can afford to monthly in mutual funds. Almost exclusively index funds, as solid research
indicated most of the managed options were unable to "beat the market". The
"MIFID II" (currently) causes some new pricing ranges and options that partly makes the research less relevant, but it is still solid enough as a base for me
to decide on index funds mostly. Some exceptions (wish I remembered a couple of fund names I heard
about in a podcast). Exciting stuff (sarcasm in statement: enabled).


Have a good one.
