# The Bubble That Does Not Burst?

Initial notes: 2020-08-06.

I caught myself wondering about something relatively trivial, yet not, as most would agree in the finance sector, which I have studied from afar mostly.
There is little to no doubt among the finance experts that markets are overpriced. Even the eccentrics seem to agree. This based on what I have heard
and read.
It is said that the markets are now run by governments and I saw
a prominent figure say we now have "zombie markets" disconnected from real economy, with higher debt and more inherent risk.


The US is being very socialistic, I think, through the FED (Federal Reserve, national bank)
by injecting all that money. Sadly it probably mostly serves to save or generate income for already wealthy people more than it does the commoner and
"most people" sufficiently good. Although avoiding bankruptcies keeps people employed, of course. As well
as other important factors. That said, it is quite contrary
to how the US represents itself politically.


I spent an evening reading about the fear and uncertainty that was all over the articles in a "random" bank blog dating back to 2011, and kept
reading until 2015 or so before I discontinued, now
in retrospect knowing it would turn out to be the longest bull (positive/up) market in history, unless I am misinformed, I read it posted by a finance expert,
so I think it is correct. It ended when the bull market ended this year if I remember correctly and there were no previous dips significant enough.
I forgot the numbers, but I think we went 10-12 years on the broad US/world financial indicator that is the 
S&P 500 index, with overall positive momentum semi short term.


The quite simple question I am then left with is if this is a bubble that will not quite burst, meaning an entirely new macro-economic reality
we need to account for as humans thinking about our pensions that increasingly are being demanded to be self-provided
due to an ageing population, or is it
a bubble after all? Debt has skyrocketed and the US debt size is frightening at this point, but as
it so happens, that is exactly the concerns they, among others, had in 2011-2015, but it did not affect the stock markets.
Governments keep injecting money and the disconnect grows. Capitalism sort of
is not allowed to work the way it was built, both for better and worse. Investors and commoners alike 
are left with this conundrum I am now debating with myself here.


If we look to history, Japan still has not recovered from the 1990 levels on the stock markets, and it is entirely possible that this can happen again,
elsewhere -
but will the governments allow it? Furthermore, will it even be their choice?
Will they "run out of tools"? How much debt can a country, particularly the US, have before - you know - 
it has any consequences...? I find the world an odd place at the moment within this sector, as I know some others also do. Is a P/E of 500 or for that
matter 8000, as I think the extreme example of the Tesla stock must be close to, just to be
expected and a green signal for investors to invest within this new reality? The correlation between asset values and income generated in companies vs
share price is maybe at record lows overall, without
having researched that to decisively make the statement (speculation and a feeling, sorry, maybe 90s Japan was close? other? ... open an issue if you know!
(part joke)).


I heard there are "new players", literally, as in young people using apps such as "Robin Hood" to trade and take enormous risks. For a young person it
is, due to expected remaining years alive, of course less risky overall to invest long term, since a recovery even from a severe crash
is more likely to occur within their lifetime and before they need the money, hopefully. But a lot is also traders. What role does this play? It provides
what is called liquidity, likely more persistently inflated prices and more money in the markets overall if my understanding is correct. Beyond that I
am not sure, but I am quite confident it somehow mostly enriches the already richest 0.n % of the population in the end. I might have a dystopian (or
in this case realistic) view.


So will the bubble burst? I know nobody knows.


What am I currently doing? Investing small parts of my salary monthly in mutual funds. Exciting stuff.


Have a good one.
