# Let's tax the banks...

... and the rest will follow. I want to briefly summarize what I see as the first baby steps outlined to support a new macro-economic reality
with QE - quantitative ease from governments in the form of purchasing financial instruments - as a new, permanent reality. Economy fails?
"Don't worry, we got your back, but don't you dare call us socialists!" - Regards FED, Sweden. The reason I mention Sweden is their recent 
proposal for a bank
tax with the reason being basically the need for money redistribution to support QE (as I most humbly _currently_ interpret it, reading a bit
between the lines). In Denmark they're
also proposing taxation of banks, there with the reason being pension money for the aging population (of hard/long working citizens). To me these
seem like "excuses" on a political level, to get money out of banks with all the (to me mostly unknown) side effects this has on the economy
as well as operation of banks.


The pattern that I see (or imagine) now, is increased taxation of banks, maybe insurance companies, and eventually who-knows-what, to support QE.
We have come to depend on it. I read researchers claimed to have proven "QE addiction" in the markets.
 With this in mind, it seems bad to let it go, and politicians
seek to increase funding for QE _in sustainable and reasonable ways_. Whether this is reasonable or not in the ultimate, grander scheme of things,
I do not have enough insight to know, but I notice it's what's being proposed. The reasoning to me seems solid. Probably there will be separate
budgets/equivalents for this bank tax money, but I'm not sure about those inner workings of politics globally or even at home. I imagine it is
camouflage 
rhetoric to keep going with the QE - and I expect more tax proposals to follow, with similar reasoning. (Written 2020-09-22).


I imagine people are already doing prognosis and whatnot of how much QE is estimated to be needed in such and such timeframes in various 
scenarios. So this is the latest riveting development I see to support a further "bubble" (as written about in a former "text") on a more permanent
basis. The wise and foresighted Swedish population is again on the ball.


No conclusions, beyond keeping my small monthly savings. "We can't let capitalism fail, because nobody likes shit from fans on their living room walls."
Please ask me for permission before you quote me on that. And as a side note... Won't the smaller tax fish be paying the biggest bill again? Banks
will transfer costs. I hope to businesses as well as everyday people, although businesses,
when they need to cut costs, tend to punish people somehow. The world sure has a lot of work to be done on it, right...? Who can disagree?
This is one
financial baby step, but I see a future with sustained QE being formed here. Hindsight will tell if I'm blessed with foresight. To be continued (by
the world)...
